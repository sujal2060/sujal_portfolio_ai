# About Me
Hello! I'm a BCA student at Tribhuvan University with a strong passion for technology and creativity. I specialize in web development, with hands-on experience in modern tools and frameworks, especially Django for building dynamic and secure web applications.

Beyond the web, I'm deeply curious about Data Science, Game Development, and 3D Design using Blender. I'm always exploring how code, data, and design can come together to build meaningful and innovative digital experiences.

Currently, I'm expanding my skills in machine learning, game physics, and 3D modeling to push the boundaries of what I can create. Whether it's crafting an engaging website, developing an intelligent system, or building a virtual world—I love bringing ideas to life through technology.
